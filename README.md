# Bot tutorial
To change the prefix, enter the command:
```
/changeprefix <prefix>
```

For standard bot mode, enter:

```
/setstandart
```

This command will reset the prefix and it will equal - "." also, if you invited the bot to your server during a technical question, then with a 99 percent chance, your server ID will not be entered into the Modmail bot database and you will not be able to change the prefix, add forbidden words, so you have two ways to do this :

```
Re-invite the bot when it is online.
```
```
Use command /setstandard
```
